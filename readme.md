**BORIS Granular Station** is a lightweight real-time granulator. It lets you zoom in into the details of sound, and explore its temporal dimension while its flowing. But honestly, do whatever you want with it.

With 0 samples of delay introduced by the plugin, BORIS is real time for real.

Features:
- The thumb on the waveform let you decide the starting position of the grains (x-axis) and its randomicity, or drift (y-axis)
- The pitch shift works at a detail of 8th of tone
- The envelope selector uses a custom interpolation to swap shape smoothly
- Freeze the audio input at any time
- Play with Feedback but be careful: since the output of the plugin can vary so much, it’s hard to come out with  feedback limations
